# Commit Messages Guidelines

## Commit Messages

- Use the common format for commit messages: "type(scope): description"
  - Don't use scope if it's not necessary.
- Only use lowercase letters in the entire body of the commit message.
- The type can be one of the following:
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - chore: A chore (non-code change)
  - refactor: A code refactor (optional; only use if it's a significant refactor)
  - test: A test change (optional; only use if it's a significant test change or new test added)
  - docs: Documentation changes
  - style: Code style changes (optional; only use if it's a significant style change)
  - perf: Performance improvements (optional; only use if it's a significant performance improvement)
- Keep it short and to the point, max 50 characters
  - Example: "feat: added new timer feature to the reports page"
  - Example: "feat: updated layout in timer page"
  - Example: "fix: fixed issue with login"
  - Example: "chore: updated dependencies"
  - Example: "refactor: refactored code in timer page - improved performance and readability, reduced code complexity, extended with new features"
  - Example: "test: added new test for timer page"
  - Example: "docs: updated documentation for timer page"
  - Example: "style: updated code style in timer page"
  - Example: "perf: improved performance of timer page"


## Commit Body

- Add a detailed description of the commit, max 60 characters (if necessary, add more details in the body, not in the subject, only if a significant change is made)


## Commit Footer

- if the commit is signed off, add the Signed-off-by: <username>
  - otherwise leave empty
